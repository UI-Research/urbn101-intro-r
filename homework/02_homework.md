# Homework

## Problem 1

Use a search engine to find a package that solves a problem that interests you (ex. mapping, network plotting). Install and load that package.

## Problem 2

Find the mean, median, maximum, and minimum of `x <- c(1, pi, exp(9), sqrt(2), sqrt(100), log(10, 10), log(10))`. Hint: assign the value to `x` and plug it into the functions for mean, median, maximum, and minimum. 

## Problem 3

Try searching for `|` with `?|`. What happens? Try again, but wrap `|` in back-ticks.  

## Problem 4

Create a new data set from the `diamonds` data set where the variable `clarity` always equals `SI2`. How many observations are in this data set? Now, drop `x`, `y`, and `z` from this data set. How many variables are in this data set?

## Problem 5

Create a new variable that is the price of the diamonds in Canadian Dollars called `price_canadian`. 1 Canadian Dollar is roughly 0.75 U.S. Dollar. 

## Problem 6

Calculate the average price of diamonds in the `diamonds` data set with `summarize`. Calculate the average price of diamonds by each `cut` in the diamonds data set with `summarize()` and `group_by()`.
