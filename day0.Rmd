# Statistical Programming

## Motivation: why statistical programming?

1) Clearly answer questions
2) Clearly communicate the answer to questions
3) Document the steps to answering a question

## Example 1

What is 2 + 2?

## Example 1

What is 2 + 2?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
2 + 2
```

## Example 2

What is the median price of diamonds with carat > 1 and a Good cut?

## Example 2

What is the median price of diamonds with carat > 1 and a Good cut?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

diamonds %>%
  filter(carat > 1, cut == "Good") %>%
  summarize(median(price))
```

How could increasing the retirement age affect the poverty rates of Hispanic women ages 62 and older?

# A brief history of R

## S

R is an implementation of S, a proprietary programming language created at Bell Labs in the 1970s.

## R

R is a free, open-soure programming language created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the Univesity of Aukland in the early 1990s.

R is mostly written in R, C, and FORTRAN.

## CRAN

The Comprehensive R Archive Network was introduced in 1997. 

## RStudio

## tidyverse

# Fundamental concepts

## Computational Reproducibility

* **Replication:** the recreation of findings across repeated studies, is a cornerstone of science. 
* **Reproducibility:** the ability to access data, source code, tools, and documentation and recreate all calculations, visualizations, and artifacts of an analysis
* *Computational reproducibility should be the minimum standard for computational social sciences and statistical programming*

## Script

* A plain text document that contains code and comments

**Map to the answer**

## Text editor/IDE


## Comments

```
# increase perc_speeding by 0.2 because of systematic underreporting
mutate(bad_drivers, perc_speeding = perc_speeding * 1.2)
```

* Clear code avoids the need for describing "what"
* Comments should focus on **"why"**




* Packages
* Coding style
* Tests
* The command line
* Data structures
* Data types
* functions/macros


* Filtering
* Summarization
