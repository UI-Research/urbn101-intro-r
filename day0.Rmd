## Motivation: why statistical programming?

1) Clearly answer questions
2) Clearly communicate the answer to questions
3) Document the steps to answering questions

## Example 1

What is 2 + 2?

## Example 1

What is 2 + 2?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
2 + 2
```

## Example 2

What is the median price of diamonds with carat > 1 and a Good cut?

## Example 2

What is the median price of diamonds with carat > 1 and a Good cut?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

diamonds %>%
  filter(carat > 1, cut == "Good") %>%
  summarize(median(price))
```

## Example 3

How could increasing the retirement age affect the poverty rates of Hispanic women ages 62 and older?

# <font color="#ffffff">Principles</font> {data-background=#1696d2}

## 1) Accuracy

Deliberate steps **should** be taken to minimize the chance of making an error and maximize the chance of catching errors when errors inevitably occur. 

## 2) Computational reproducibility

Computational reproducibility **should** be embraced to improve accuracy, promote transparency, and prove the quality of analytical work. 

## 3) Human interpretability

Code **should** be written so humans can easily understand what’s happening—even if it occasionally sacrifices machine performance.

## 4) Portability

Analyses **should** be designed so strangers can understand each and every step without additional instruction or inquiry from the original analyst. 

## 5) Accessibility

Research and data are non-rival and non-exclusive. They are public goods that **should** be widely and easily shared. Decisions about tools, methods, data, and language during the research process **should** be made in ways that promote the ability of anyone and everyone to access an analysis. 

## 6) Efficiency

Analysts **should** seek to make all parts of the research process more efficient with clear communication, by adopting best practices, and by managing computation. 

## Principles

1) Accuracy
2) Computational reproducibility
3) Human interpretability
4) Portability
5) Accessibility

# <font color="#ffffff">Fundamental concepts</font> {data-background=#1696d2}

## Text editor/IDE

```{r out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/rstudio.png")
```

* R == free, open source programming language
* RStudio == for-profit company and Itegrated Development Environment (IDE)

## RStudio

```{r out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/rstudio.svg")
```

## The R console

```{r out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/rstudio-console.png")
```

## Computational Reproducibility

* **Replication:** the recreation of findings across repeated studies, is a cornerstone of science. 
* **Reproducibility:** the ability to access data, source code, tools, and documentation and recreate all calculations, visualizations, and artifacts of an analysis
* *Computational reproducibility should be the minimum standard for computational social sciences and statistical programming*

## Script

```{r out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/rstudio-script.png")
```

* A plain text document that contains code and comments
* **Map to the answer**
* `.R` and `.Rmd`

## Comments

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# fivethirtyeight contains bad_drivers
library(fivethirtyeight)

# increase perc_speeding because of systematic underreporting
mutate(bad_drivers, perc_speeding = perc_speeding * 1.2)
```

* Clear code avoids the need for describing **<font color="#1696d2">"what"</font>**
* Comments should focus on **<font color="#1696d2">"why"</font>**

## Coding style

*"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread."* ~ Hadley Wickham

* CamelCase
* camelCase
* snake_case

[tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

## R Packages

Collections of R, C, C++, and FORTRAN code that expand the functionality of R. 

```{r out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/urbnmapr.png")
```

## CRAN

The Comprehensive R Archive Network was introduced in 1997. 

Repository of popular R packages with basic standards and quality control. 

## tidyverse {data-background=#fdeba4}

```{r out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/tidyverse.png")
```

Comprehensive set of tools for data science

Core: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats

## tidyverse {data-background=#fdeba4}

```{r out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/r4ds.png")
```

## Installing and loading packages

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# run only once ever(ish) and don't include in scripts
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# include at the top of scripts and run once per session
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data structures

Scalars (do not exist in R)

Vectors
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

Matrices

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
matrix(c(1:2, 3:4, 5:6), nrow = 2)
```

Data frames, multidimensional arrays

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
msleep %>%
  select(name, awake, brainwt, bodywt) %>%
  head(n = 4)
```

## Data types

Character

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
```

Numeric

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

Logical

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
```

Factor

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
factor(c("good", "ok", "bad", "ok", "ok"), levels = c("good", "ok", "bad"))
```

## Missing values

A great strength of R!

`NA` is R's encoding for missing values. 

Missing values are contagious. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA))
```

## Assignment

R can hold many different objects at the same time. This requires assignment. 

`<-`

```{r echo = TRUE}
a <- 2
b <- 2

a + b

c <- a + b
c
```

## Functions

Arguments by position

```{r echo = TRUE}
mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA), 0.2, TRUE)
```

Arguments by name

```{r echo = TRUE}
mean(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA), trim = 0.2, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Function documentation
`?mean`

## Custom functions

Rule of three: never program something three or more times

```{r echo = TRUE}
test_oddness <- function(x) {
  ifelse(x %% 2 == 0, "even!", "odd!")
}

test_oddness(1:10)
```

## Tests

What will it take to convince you that your code is correct?

1) Assign monthly observations to fiscal years
  * <font color="#ffffff">Are there 12 months per year?</font>
2) Link observations from 2017 to observations from 2018.
  * <font color="#ffffff">Do non-matching variables that shouldn't change change?</font>
3) Tax calculator
  * <font color="#ffffff">Are values that must be positive non-positive?</font>

* Write the test first!
* Each time you encounter a bug, write a test that will convince you the bug no longer exists.
