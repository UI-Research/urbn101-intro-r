## Motivation: why statistical programming?

1) Clearly answer questions
2) Clearly communicate the answer to questions
3) Document the steps to answering a question

## Example 1

What is 2 + 2?

What is 2 + 2?

```{r, echo = TRUE}

What is the median price of diamonds with carat > 1 and a Good cut?

```{r, echo = TRUE}

# <font color="#ffffff">Principles</font> {data-background=#1696d2}

## Principles

1) Accuracy
2) Computational reproducibility
3) Human interpretability
4) Portability
5) Accessibility
6) Efficiency

## 1) Accuracy

Deliberate steps **should** be taken to minimize the chance of making an error and maximize the chance of catching errors when errors inevitably occur. 

## 2) computational reproducibility

Computational reproducibility **should** be embraced to improve accuracy, promote transparency, and prove the quality of analytical work. 

## 3) Human interpretability

Code **should** be written so humans can easily understand what’s happening—even if it occasionally sacrifices machine performance.

## 4) Portability

Analyses **should** be designed so strangers can understand each and every step without additional instruction or inquiry from the original analyst. 

## 5) Accessibility

Research and data are non-rival and non-exclusive. They are public goods that **should** be widely and easily shared. Decisions about tools, methods, data, and language during the research process **should** be made in ways that promote the ability of anyone and everyone to access an analysis. 

## 6) Efficiency

Analysts **should** seek to make all parts of the research process more efficient with clear communication, by adopting best practices, and by managing computation.

# <font color="#ffffff">A brief history of R</font> {data-background=#1696d2}

## S

R is an implementation of the S programming language, which was created at Bell Labs in the 1970s.

S-PLUS is a proprietary implementation of R that was common for years.

## R

R is a free, open-soure programming language created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the Univesity of Aukland in the early 1990s.

R is mostly written in R, C, and FORTRAN.

## CRAN

The Comprehensive R Archive Network was introduced in 1997. 

Repository of popular R packages with basic standards and quality control. 

## tidyverse {data-background=#fdeba4}

```{r out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/tidyverse.png")
```

Comprehensive set of tools for data science

Core: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats

## RStudio

```{r out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/rstudio.svg")
```

IDE and for-profit company that funded and professionalized R development

## Text editor/IDE

```{r out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/rstudio.png")
```

* R == free, open source programming language
* RStudio == for-profit company and Itegrated Development Environment (IDE)

## The R console

```{r out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/rstudio-console.png")
```

## Computational Reproducibility

* **Replication:** the recreation of findings across repeated studies, is a cornerstone of science. 
* **Reproducibility:** the ability to access data, source code, tools, and documentation and recreate all calculations, visualizations, and artifacts of an analysis
* *Computational reproducibility should be the minimum standard for computational social sciences and statistical programming*

## Script

```{r out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/images/rstudio-script.png")
```

* A plain text document that contains code and comments
* **Map to the answer**
* `.R` and `.Rmd`

## Comments

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# fivethirtyeight contains bad_drivers
library(fivethirtyeight)

# increase perc_speeding because of systematic underreporting
mutate(bad_drivers, perc_speeding = perc_speeding * 1.2)
```

* Clear code avoids the need for describing **<font color="#1696d2">"what"</font>**
* Comments should focus on **<font color="#1696d2">"why"</font>**

## Coding style

*"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread."* ~ Hadley Wickham

* CamelCase
* camelCase
* snake_case

[tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

## R Packages

Collections of R, C, C++, and FORTRAN code that expand the functionality of R.
