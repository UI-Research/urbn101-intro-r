# Homework

## Problem 1

Load the tidyverse with `library(tidyverse)`. Submit `data()` to see a list of available data sets. 

Pick a data set from the section labelled ggplot2. Explore the data set. 

## Problem 2

Build a bar plot, a line plot, and a scatter plot from that data frame.

## Problem 3

Look up the `geom_*()` function for the following types of plots:

* histogram
* kernel density plot
* ridgeline plot
* hex scatter plot

## Problem 4

Build a column plot, a bar plot, a line plot, and a scatter plot from the above data frame. This time, use `filter()` to create a subset of the data and pipe it directly to `ggplot()` with `%>%`.
